# redux

 **redux**  folder is used for storing data. It contains reducers, store, actions, constants.

### reducer.js

>**reducer is** a function that determines changes to an application's state. It uses the action it receives to determine this change. We have tools, like Redux, that help manage an application's state changes in a single store so that they behave consistently.

### store.js
>A **store is** an immutable object tree in **Redux**. A **store ** is a state container which holds the application's state. **Redux** can have only a single **store** in your application. Whenever a **store is** created in **Redux**, you need to specify the reducer.
